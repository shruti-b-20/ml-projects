# Cervical Cancer Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the risk of cervical cancer using machine learning models. The prediction is based on various medical features obtained from patient data. The project includes a Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model training, and a pre-trained model file for making predictions.
